S3, Glacier, EBS(dedicated to EC2, compute services), EFS(Elastic File system, nfs based)

S3
	-> primary uses
	-> saves meta data of file + actual file = called object 
	-> internet scale storage
	-> built-in redundancy
	-> provides API, Amazon CLI, SNS, SQS
		Region -> Buckets -> Objects
		https://BUCKETNAME.amazonaws.com/OBJECTNAME
	-> can save media files, static files, can serves as Web Server

S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage
	-> secondary backup
	-> lower cost

Glacier
	-> lowest cost
	-> Archival storage, not used frequently
	-> does not retreve the object in realtime
	-> takes 3-4 hours to retrive just like a tape drive
		-> direct glacier API/SDK... manage own meta data
		-> upload object to S3.. manage object life cycle policy to move data to glacier
		-> third party tools to push data to glacier  

FEATURES
============
S3 advanced feature
	-> s3 versioning
	-> to enable this feature click check boxes on ASW console(data protection)
	-> can configure how many verions to have
	-> new features 
		-> cross-region replication
			-> lower latency
			-> complience
			-> security, versioning required

S3 notification
	-> SNS             .. mobile
	-> SQS             .. uses by compute service
	-> lambda function .. event based trigger



S3 VPCE(Virtual private endpoint)
S3 data encryption
	-> client side encryption
	-> configure via check box, server side encryption(SSE) let AWS do it, the way it handles
	-> SSE with clients key we provide key to server

AWS data injest option
	-> Direct connect
	-> internet/VPN
	-> Storage Gateway
	-> Import/Export
	
Use cases S3
	-> build scalable we  application no worry of storage
	-> media store
	-> stagin area for big data analytics

CloudFront
	-> CDN
	-> data travelling in cloud front is free
